        <p><b>Hello, is it me you're looking for?</b></p>
        <p>
            If you look up about two inches, you'll see my name is Anne Jordan. And if you spend any amount of time on this website, you'll see that it's not
            the most mobile friendly of websites which is rather frustrating both to build and to look at. So we should both feel bad shouldn't we. On the plus side, I figured out how to 
            add a background image. Have a look around, maybe you'll see some cats...maybe you won't. You'll never find out if you just stay on this home page toggling the sizes back and forth
            now will you?
        </p>
         
        <p><b>Well, I'd love to stay and chat, but then who'd look around this awesome website?</b></p>
